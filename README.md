# UM_SI670_Lake_Temperature_Prediction

## Trout Lake
Lake monitoring provides important information for environment protection and pollution identification, such as temperature/thermal monitoring. In this Kaggle task, we will provide thermal sensor data for multiple lakes and ask you to predict/estimate the temperature at a certain depth for certain lakes.

## Green Lake
The extra credit task is predicting the temperature of Greenwood Lake at depth [1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, 9.5, 10.5, 11.5, 12.5, 14.5, 16.5, 18.5, 20.5, 22.5, 24.5, 26.5, 28.5] during Dec 2017.
